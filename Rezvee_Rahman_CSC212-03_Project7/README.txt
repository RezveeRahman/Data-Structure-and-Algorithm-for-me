This file has linkedlist.py and Node.py

The node class is contained in both of these files however

Using the import Node will not properly apply a class or a class's method to recieving class file
I have found a solution using

from Nodes import Node

This is not neccessary. But this was an error i had previously as well. I will keep this document in mind the next time I code using classes

To start the program, execute Main2.py

NOTE NOT A ERROR MESSAGE
I'm aware that the program will print a message saying that a node can't be found.
This is due to the commands of the program.
Hit enter to continue through the end.
The linked list is Alphabetically organized.
The inheritance works.
